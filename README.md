The datasets listed above are compiled to facilitate the development and testing of algorithms for Bangla Sign Language recognition. Each dataset varies by the number of classes, type of data provided (e.g., RGB video, depth maps, skeleton data), the total number of videos, the number of signers, availability (whether the dataset is publicly available or private), and links to the dataset's descriptive PDF and the dataset itself.

## Availability

The availability column indicates whether a dataset is publicly accessible or private. For datasets marked as private, researchers may need to contact the dataset providers for access permissions.
